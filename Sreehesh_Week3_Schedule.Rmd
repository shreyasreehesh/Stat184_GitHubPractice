# Schedule

### AMST 105 - American Pop Cultrue and Folk Life

One interesting class I'm taking this semester is American Pop Culture and Folk Life. This class takes place every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 11:15 AM to 12:05 PM. The focus of the class is the 1960s. For the majority of the course, we will study the influence of media and music on major events that occurred in the 1960s. One example is the study of the Civil Rights Movement in which we learned how music had inspired people to protest the discrimination against African Americans in the 60s. One example of influential music is the "When Do I Get to Be Called a Man" by Big Bill Broonzy  This song discusses the inferiority that Black men felt in the 1960s since they were viewed as "boys" rather than "men." The song can be listend to using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fpsu.instructure.com%2Fcourses%2F2340793%2Fpages%2Fbig-bill-broonzy-when-do-i-get-to-be-called-a-man%3Fmodule_item_id%3D42188745&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjQsMTY0NTAz&v=nBKhqvam8Yg&feature=youtu.be

### MongoDB

Last semester I had the pleasure of learning more about data base management systems such as MongoDB and SQL. Over the summer, I focused more on MongoDB to hopefully get certified as an associate developer. I spent most of the summer learning this to help me prepare. So far this semester, I have been busy, but I'm still trying to learn more so that when I'm ready I can retake the Exam and get certified. I hope to do this during the weekends. The link for the MongoDB University: https://learn.mongodb.com/.

### Lambda Sigma Honors Society

Lambda Sigma Honors Society is a Honors Society in which second-year undergraduate students partake in fellowship, leadership, service, and scholarship. This includes volunteering for local companies and helping the community. My role in this club is the Service Member which means I have the pleasure to help organize and come up with service opportunities for members to fulfill their volunteer requirements and help the community. Meetings occur about every week as an executive member, but we host service opportunities almost twice a month. This is the link to their website: https://lambdasigma.org/.
